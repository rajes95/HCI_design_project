# Human Computer Interaction Design Project

This repository consists of my HCI design project from the preliminary design, through the development of storyboards, the development and testing of paper prototypes, and creation of medium- to high-resolution functional prototypes. The range of topics covered includes the principles of human-computer interaction and the design and evaluation of user interfaces.

# Short Description

EasyEmail is a new email service that is packed with features to make it user friendly and
hassle-free. It is designed for people that are tired of having to clean out their inbox or sift
through tons of old emails to find what they are looking for. EasyEmail has all the features
offered by other email services such as a powerful search and filter tool, easy read and
compose email interfaces, spell checking, and auto-suggesting of frequently used phrases. One
of which is the ‘auto-delete’ feature, which might sound scary but is actually very helpful. The
other feature includes easy usability, Auto-archive. The user can set a time frame (5-360 days)
in which an email will be deleted after it is received thus preventing old emails from piling up in
their inbox. If the email is important and should be saved for an indefinite amount of time, it can
be placed in a separate folder where it will stay until the user moves or deletes it themselves.
This feature along with our other organizing tools will help the user to stay organized and only
keep the emails that are important to them.


As part of this project, we went through different phases of designing a prototype of the project.
The sub-folders indicate different stages of development of the design for Easy email
application.
